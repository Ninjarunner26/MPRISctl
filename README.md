# MPRISctl
A simple tool for controlling MPRIS media players.
Like [playerctl](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) but worse.

## Install
Either make sure you've got rust and cargo installed, or use the dev container.
Clone the repo and cd into the directory. Then run:
```
cargo build --release
```
Under target/release/ there will be a binary. Make it executable and stick it somewhere that's in your path.
